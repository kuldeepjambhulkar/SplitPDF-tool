# PDF Splitter Tool

## Overview
The **PDF Splitter Tool** is a Python-based utility designed to split large PDF files into smaller, more manageable PDF documents. This tool is particularly useful for breaking down extensive PDF files into specified page ranges, making it easier to manage, share, or upload smaller sections. The tool leverages the `PyPDF2` library for seamless and accurate PDF manipulation.

## Features
- **Customizable Splits:** Define the number of pages per split to create smaller PDFs.
- **Accurate Page Handling:** Maintains the original content and layout in each split.
- **User-Friendly:** Simple script setup with minimal requirements.
- **Cross-Platform:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Only requires Python and `PyPDF2`.

## Installation
Ensure Python is installed on your system. Install the necessary library using:

```bash
pip install --user PyPDF2
```
## Further Development  
- Extend this tool by transforming it into a web application or a desktop application. This would make the tool more accessible and user-friendly, allowing users to split PDFs directly through a graphical interface without needing to run Python scripts.
- Potential enhancements include drag-and-drop functionality & visual progress indicators.
- As of now, error handling is not implemented
